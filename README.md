## Introduction

MVImgNet2.0 contains âˆ¼300k real-world objects in 340+ classes, expands [MVImgNet](https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/MVImgNet) to a total of ~520k real-life objects and 515 categories. The annotation comprehensively covers object masks, camera parameters, and point clouds.

### Updates

- We have uploaded the script for downloading MVImgNet2.0.
- We have released the first part of MVImgNet2.0, which contains ~180k videos. Please fill out the above form to get the download links. We will release the remaining videos recently.

### Folder structure
```
|-- ROOT
    |-- class_label
        |-- instance_id
            |-- images
            |-- masks
            |-- sparse/0 # camera parameters and sparse point clouds in colmap format
                |-- cameras.bin   
                |-- images.bin    
                |-- points3D.bin   
```

The mapping between `class_label` and class name can be found in `mvimgnet2_category.json` (The json file contains all the categories of MVImgNet and MVImgNet2.0, to use the data of MVImgNet, please refer to [MVImgNet](https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/MVImgNet) for dataset download).

The `images` folder contains the multi-view images, the `masks` folder contains the corresponding object masks, and the `sparse` folder contains the reconstructed camera parameters in COLMAP format. It is recommended to use the functions provided by [COLMAP](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/dev/scripts/python/read_write_model.py) to read the binary files under `sparse` folder.
